Project Overview
Measured resistance at five positions on an aluminum-coated wafer.
Conducted repeated measurements over time to observe stability and drift.
Compared results using basic statistics and linear regression to identify trends.
Interpreted findings to assess the consistency of the film deposition.

This study was completed as part of an undergraduate research experience in electrical engineering.

 Skills Demonstrated

Statistical analysis (mean, variance, standard deviation)
Trend analysis using linear regression
Plotting and interpretation of time-series measurement data
Identifying sources of measurement variability

Technical Communication

Key Findings (Summary)

Resistance measurements showed consistency across positions, with relatively small deviations.
Time-dependent drift was minimal, suggesting good probe stability.
Slight upward drift shortly after probe placement indicated that allowing the film to rest before measuring may improve accuracy.
Results suggest good uniformity in the evaporated aluminum layer.

 Future Improvements

If repeated today, the experiment could be extended using:

Automated data capture

Temperature-controlled measurements

More sample positions for finer spatial resolution

Inclusion of uncertainty propagation and error modeling
